    bio: "I am developing my career as a Full-Stack Developer, with a strong focus on building modern web applications and continuously expanding my technical skills. I work with JavaScript and TypeScript, React, Next.js, and Node.js, with experience in both frontend and backend development, databases, REST APIs, and authentication. \n Alongside application development, I am expanding my knowledge and practical skills in DevOps and infrastructure. I work with Docker, Terraform, Ansible, and CI/CD, and in my recent projects I have also been working with deployment, monitoring, and observability using tools such as Prometheus and Grafana. I am interested in the entire lifecycle of an application — from development and testing to deployment, monitoring, and maintenance. \n My goal is to continue growing as a Full-Stack Developer while building a strong foundation in DevOps and infrastructure.",
